----------- Summary of what was done:
  1. Started Horizon management hub services: agbot, exchange, postgres DB, CSS, mongo DB, vault
  2. Created exchange resources: system org (IBM) admin user, user org (issy) and admin user, and agbot
    Automatically generated these passwords/tokens:
      EXCHANGE_ROOT_PW=1h52MokTrcIdWUVixaDw9hvCjyVoZ4
      EXCHANGE_HUB_ADMIN_PW=n6FIPBR72TQAgPL4sfMpCqknqA1MMy
      EXCHANGE_SYSTEM_ADMIN_PW=fIohDCc4dVSz8uCUxSCICQzHEQLQWo
      AGBOT_TOKEN=TOzYWacozDGmFXkp8FgM3PTzBoWV9S
      EXCHANGE_USER_ADMIN_PW=nw99XXoM8ybbvFNvTwuaHnZSHk4OxF
      HZN_DEVICE_TOKEN=218PojKMsHM0OJrvtQB35uQwwrL7w4
    Important: save these generated passwords/tokens in a safe place. You will not be able to query them from Horizon.
  3. Installed and configured the Horizon CLI (hzn)
  4. Created a Horizon developer key pair
  5. Created a vault instance: https://192.168.1.199:8200/ui/vault/auth?with=token
    Automatically generated this key/token:
      VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY=
      VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN=
    Important: save this generated key/token in a safe place. You will not be able to query them from Horizon.
  6. Added the hzn auto-completion file to ~/.bashrc (but you need to source that again for it to take effect in this shell session)
