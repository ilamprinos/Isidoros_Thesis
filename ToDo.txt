    Continue https://open-horizon.github.io/docs/mgmt-hub/docs/index.html#horizon-exchange-commands.

20/2 
    Check the last step I have written in the instructions(192.168.1.8).
21/2
    For some reason it does not find the node hzn exchange node list.

25/2 
    I will Continue from https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/open-horizon-integration/blob/main/hub/04-configure-anax.md after the Created keys.

1/3 
    Continue https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/open-horizon-integration/blob/main/hub/04-configure-anax.md 
    wherever the instructions are left.

3/3 
    Continue https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/open-horizon-integration/blob/main/hub/05-view-device-data.md 
    I left it in the modify the device settings section.

7/3 Go the other way, use the ./deploy script for everything and then run edgeX according to https://github.com/edgexfoundry-holding/open-horizon-integration/blob/main/hub/04-configure-anax.md

8/3 Continue step 24 from the instructions.

13/3
    I have to Check how the hub can read the edgeX node's logs, how the information can be sent back to the "cloud" for decision making.
    I also have to check how to deploy each microservice of edgeX independently and if they are deployed in different nodes can they
    communicate with one another.

18/3 I need to check sites for similar content to my thesis. Start the overleaf with the template.
    Potential ways forward include refactoring the example so that individual EXF micro-services
    are implemented as individual Open Horizon Services, or adding the SMA to the Open Horizon Service definition.
