----------- Summary of what was done:
  1. Started Horizon management hub services: agbot, exchange, postgres DB, CSS, mongo DB, vault
  2. Created exchange resources: system org (IBM) admin user, user org (issy) and admin user, and agbot
    Automatically generated these passwords/tokens:
      EXCHANGE_ROOT_PW=x2MUKXGkyf7MEB9t4bxDkwvHwvGlgE
      EXCHANGE_HUB_ADMIN_PW=jLt3uSws6GzS0xeYXpHbdWjzX5AOJm
      EXCHANGE_SYSTEM_ADMIN_PW=wyLFjuNypLvPAsZNdXu4RfcXL75mTF
      AGBOT_TOKEN=QnxMUCPaHOMY4iqc51ToleSG0nTXel
      EXCHANGE_USER_ADMIN_PW=9bpAYLQ6NB09JLfrBJQOaGIU3CRbY9
      HZN_DEVICE_TOKEN=qnF4QajCf78ZFTbauw2uzb3zZXAS82
    Important: save these generated passwords/tokens in a safe place. You will not be able to query them from Horizon.
  3. Installed and configured the Horizon agent and CLI (hzn)
  4. Created a Horizon developer key pair
  5. Created and registered an edge node to run the helloworld example edge service
  6. Created a vault instance: https://192.168.1.43:8200/ui/vault/auth?with=token
    Automatically generated this key/token:
      VAULT_UNSEAL_KEY=
      VAULT_ROOT_TOKEN=
    Important: save this generated key/token in a safe place. You will not be able to query them from Horizon.
  7. Added the hzn auto-completion file to ~/.bashrc (but you need to source that again for it to take effect in this shell session)
